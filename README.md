# iHungry — Java Swing OOP (Burger Orders)

A compact Java Swing application (coursework) that demonstrates basic OOP design and a custom singly linked list for managing burger orders.

This README gives a clear overview, quick start instructions for Windows PowerShell, sample data format, and developer notes so you can build, run and extend the project.

## Overview

iHungry is a small desktop GUI application for managing burger orders. It was created as an OOP/DS exercise and uses plain text CSV storage (`Burger.txt`) for persistence.

The UI is implemented with Java Swing (NetBeans-generated forms). The application demonstrates:

- A simple domain model: `Burger` (orderID, customerID, customerName, qty, status).
- A coursework-style custom `LinkedList` implementation used by controllers.
- File-based persistence with CSV parsing and basic controllers for searching, sorting and updating orders.

## Quick facts

- Language: Java (8+)
- UI: Java Swing (NetBeans-generated forms)
- Entry point: `View.MainWindow` (contains `main`)
- Data file: `Burger.txt` (CSV rows at repository root)

## Build & Run (PowerShell)

These instructions assume you have a JDK installed and `javac`/`java` available on PATH. You can also use the included Ant script if you prefer IDE/Ant builds.

1) Build with Ant (if Ant is available):

```powershell
# From repository root
ant
# The Ant script generated by NetBeans may compile classes into `build/classes` or a similar folder.
```

2) Quick manual compile + run (PowerShell-friendly):

```powershell
# Create classes output dir
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path build\classes

# Compile every .java under src into build/classes
Get-ChildItem -Path src -Recurse -Filter "*.java" | ForEach-Object { javac -d build\classes $_.FullName }

# Run the application (entry point: View.MainWindow)
java -cp build\classes View.MainWindow
```

Notes:

- If you get errors about missing resources (icons/images), check `src/View` and the `resorces/` folder — some generated forms reference image resources.
- Running from an IDE (NetBeans / IntelliJ) is the easiest way to launch and debug forms.

## Sample data (`Burger.txt`)

The controllers expect a CSV row format in `Burger.txt`:

```
orderID,customerID,customerName,qty,status
```

Status mapping in `Burger` class:

- 0 = PROCESSING
- 1 = DELIVERED
- 2 = CANCEL

Example rows (add these to `Burger.txt` for testing):

```
B0001,C001,John Doe,2,0
B0002,C002,Jane Smith,5,1
B0003,C001,John Doe,1,2
```

Be careful: existing `Burger.txt` is used directly by the controllers, so keep a copy before editing.

## Key classes & responsibilities

- `BurgerModel.Burger` — domain object representing an order. Fields: orderID, customerID, customerName, qty, status. Also contains static constants for statuses and price.
- `BurgerController.LinkedList` — coursework custom singly linked list used to store `Burger` objects in-memory and provide operations like add, remove, get, set, toArray.
- `BurgerController.BurgerController` — file-backed controller with methods to generate order IDs, search by order/customer, update orders, load all burgers for a given status, sort by quantity, etc.
- `View.MainWindow` — application entry point (main). Also contains UI buttons that open other forms: `Placeorder`, `MainviewOrders`, `Updateform`, `MainSearch`, etc.

---

## Development notes & caveats

- Persistence is a plain CSV text file. Concurrency and atomic updates are not handled; editing the file externally may corrupt the expected format.
- Some controller methods assume specific filename casing (`Burger.txt` vs `burger.txt`) — be consistent with the file name on case-insensitive Windows, but be aware it may cause issues on case-sensitive environments.
- Error handling is minimal in places (exceptions are sometimes swallowed). Consider adding logging and better exception propagation for robust behavior.
- The `LinkedList` implementation is intentionally simple and not thread-safe — fine for single-threaded coursework applications.

Suggested small improvements (low risk):

1. Normalize file reads/writes to use the same filename and use `Files`/`Path` APIs.
2. Add basic unit tests for `LinkedList` operations and `Burger` parsing.
3. Add a small `data/sample-Burger.txt` committed file with example rows for easier manual testing.

If you want, I can:

- Run a quick compile in the workspace and report any errors (PowerShell compile command).
- Create a `data/sample-Burger.txt` with the example rows above.

Tell me which of those you'd like me to do next.
